Computer network programming

Computer network programming involves writing computer programs 
that enable processes to communicate with each other across a computer network.

Connection-oriented and connectionless communications
Most of communications can be divided into connection-oriented, and connectionless. 
Whether a communication is connection-oriented or connectionless, is defined 
by the communication protocol, and not by application programming interface(API). 
Examples of the connection-oriented protocols include Transmission Control Protocol 
(TCP) and examples of connectionless protocols include User Datagram Protocol (UDP). 

Clients and servers
For connection-oriented communications, communication parties usually have different roles. 
One party is usually waiting for incoming connections; 
this party is usually referred to as "server". 
Another party is the one which initiates connection; 
this party is usually referred to as "client".

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the Internet protocol suite. 
It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented 
the Internet Protocol (IP). 
Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
UDP is a connectionless protocol, meaning that messages are sent without 
negotiating a connection. UDP does not keep track of what it has sent. 
UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different
functions at the source and destination of the datagram.
